## INTRODUCTION

- An **Embedded Linux Toolchain** is a set of software tools designed for developing, compiling, and debugging applications or kernels for embedded systems running Linux. It includes a cross-compiler, such as GCC, which generates machine code for the target architecture (e.g., ARM or RISC-V). Supporting tools like the assembler, linker, and utilities from binutils manage the compilation and binary creation process, ensuring compatibility with the embedded system's hardware.
