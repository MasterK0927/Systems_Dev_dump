## INTRODUCTION

- An **Embedded Linux Toolchain** is a set of software tools designed for developing, compiling, and debugging applications or kernels for embedded systems running Linux. It includes a cross-compiler, such as GCC, which generates machine code for the target architecture (e.g., ARM or RISC-V). Supporting tools like the assembler, linker, and utilities from binutils manage the compilation and binary creation process, ensuring compatibility with the embedded system's hardware.

## Components

Toolchain also incorporates a standard C library, such as glibc, uClibc, or musl, which provides essential system functions like I/O, memory management, and threading. A debugger like GDB plays a crucial role in troubleshooting by allowing us to debug code directly on the target device. Build systems, such as Make or CMake, simplify and automate the compilation process, streamlining development for complex projects.

## Utilities

Additionally, tools like Buildroot and Yocto are often used to create the root filesystem, which includes all necessary libraries and tools for the embedded system to operate. Bootloader integration tools, such as U-Boot utilities, facilitate seamless deployment of the operating system and application software. The toolchain runs on a host development system and is configured to produce binaries and code specifically tailored for the embedded target system.
